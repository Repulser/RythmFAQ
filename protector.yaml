Troubleshooting:
    When I mute people, they can still send messages in channels: |
        <br/> If they can send messages in some channels, it's likely an override issue.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>Ensure that the channel overrides are not allowing them to send messages</b>.
        <br/>
        <br/> For each channel:
        <br/> go to <b>Edit Channel</b> &gt; <b>Permissions</b> &gt; Go though every role and member override <b>(that isn't the muted role)</b>, and ensure that the <b>Send Messages</b> permission isn't checked.
        <br/>
        <br/> <u>For every role except muted:</u>
        <br/> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6xgvAL0.png"/>
        <br/>
        <br/> <u>For the muted role:</u>
