        <br/> You can see a list of commands by typing <b>!help</b> in your server, or by visiting the following link:
        <br/>

        <br/>

        <br/>
        <br/> <a href="https://rythmbot.co/rythm2">https://rythmbot.co/rythm2</a>
    How do I change the channel where Rythm announces the songs in?: |
        <br/> Rythm announces the songs in the same text channel it was originally called from.
        <br/>
        <br/> If you summon Rythm in channel #general, all Announce Songs messages will appear in that channel.
        <br/>
        <br/> To change the channel where it’ll show the messages, just <b>!disconnect</b> Rythm from the current channel and <b>!summon</b> it in the channel you want the songs to be announced in.
    How can I view more than one page using the queue command?: |
        <br/> <b><code>!queue [page number]</code></b>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b><u>Example</u></b>: !queue 2
        <br/>
        <br/> For a full list of commands type <b>!help</b> in your server with Rythm in it.
    How can I remove all the duplicate songs in the current queue?: |
        <br/> To remove duplicates from Rythm's queue you must use the following command:
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>!removedupes</b>
        <br/>
        <br/> Rythm should then purge its queue of any duplicate songs.
    Why can some normal users access moderative music commands?: |
        <br/> Normal users with no special permissions are only allowed to use the <b>!play</b> command to add songs to the queue by default.
        <br/> They can also use other commands that don't affect the playing music in any way. Example: <b>!queue</b> and <b>!lyrics</b>.
        <br/>
        <br/> However, <b>normal users can access ALL music commands when they are alone with Rythm in the voice channel</b>.
        <br/> This is because their commands would not affect anyone but themselves.
        <br/>
        <br/> For more information about users command permissions, refer to the <b>>Roles/Permissions</b> section in this FAQ.
    How many votes are needed for a song to be vote skipped?: |
        <br/> For a vote skip to take effect, 75% of the voice chat's population need to vote yes.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>Here's an example</b>:
        <br/>
        <br/> Let's assume there are 10 users in a voice chat.
        <br/> The threshold for skipping is calculated as 75% of 10 = 7.5, then rounded down, so 7.
        <br/> For the vote skip to take effect, you would then need 7 positive votes.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>Note: </b> Vote skip will not be active until there are 3 or more people in the voice channel.
        <br/> (As with one person, insta-skip is enabled and with two the threshold for skipping is 1).
Limitations/Restrictions:
    Can I have 2 Rythms in the same server?: |
        <br/> <b> Short answer</b>: <code>Yes.</code>
        <br/>
        <br/> We now allow you to get a second version of Rythm at:
        <br/>
        <br/> <a href="https://rythmbot.co/rythm2">https://rythmbot.co/rythm2</a>
    Can I change Rythm's profile picture (avatar) in my server?: |
        <br/> <b> Short answer</b>: <code>No.</code>
        <br/>
        <br/> Discord doesn’t allow for users or bots to have a different profile picture per server.
    Which sites does Rythm allow?: |
        <br/> Rythm currently supports the following audio streaming services:
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>•</b> YouTube
        <br/> <b>•</b> SoundCloud
        <br/> <b>•</b> Twitch
        <br/> <b>•</b> Vimeo
        <br/> <b>•</b> Mixer
    Can I adjust the volume for everyone on my server for Rythm?: |
        <br/> <b>Short answer</b>: <code>If you donate.</code>
        <br/>
        <br/> You may set the local volume of Rythm for yourself by selecting Rythm and adjusting the user volume slider as shown below.
        <br/>
        <br/> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/qd6w5Yd.png" alt="Discord user volume"/>
        <br/>
        <br/> Rythm uses the default volume for videos when using audio streams, for donators we allow for encoding to change the volume of these audio streams.
        <br/> Due to the fact that encoding takes resources and time, this is why we do not roll this feature out to all Rythm users.
        <br/>
        <br/> For donators the volume command is <b>!volume</b> <code>number</code> <i>(Allowed Values: 1 --> 200)</i>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b><u>Example</u></b>: !volume 80
    Can I make custom commands for Rythm?: |
        <br/> <b>Short answer</b>: <code>No.</code>
        <br/>
        <br/> We do not allow custom commands/aliases, however we do allow for suggestions of aliases to be added.
        <br/>
        <br/> Use the <code>!aliases</code> command to view all the aliases.
        <br/> You can suggest any aliases that you can think of in the <code>#rythm-suggestions</code> channel on the Rythm Bot Discord server.
    Can Rythm play 24/7?: |
        <br/> <b>Short answer</b>: <code>No.</code>
        <br/>
        <br/> Rythm is not a 24/7 bot. However, you can host your own bot to access such feature, such as <a href="https://github.com/repulser/moosic">this bot (https://github.com/repulser/moosic)</a>.
    Why isn't Rythm open source?: |
        <br/> Rythm isn't open source mainly because of the following reasons:
        <br/>
        <br/> • Rythm's code isn't portable in any sense so the code isn't built for anyone to deploy it.
        <br/> • We do not wish for Rythm to become the next bot everyone ends up emulating.
        <br/> • We do not want people to rip apart any credit we have from the code and redistributing.
Roles/Permissions:
    What users can use what command?: |
        <br/> Rythm’s built-in permission system can be divided in the following groups:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b> <u> Normal</b> Users / Users <b>without</b> any special roles</u>:
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>•</b> Are able to add songs to the list (queue) but can’t remove them.
        <br/> <b>•</b> Are able to use commands that don’t interfere with other people’s music. <b>Example</b>: lyrics, np, queue, etc.
        <br/> <b>•</b> Can't skip a song without voting.
        <br/> <b>•</b> Don’t have access to control the music in any way.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/> <u>Users with a <b>DJ role</b> / <b>Manage Channels</b> permission</u>:
        <br/>
        <br/> • Have full access to all music commands.
        <br/> • Can’t change Rythm’s settings.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>Note</b>: If there isn’t a role named "<b>DJ</b>" in your server, one can be created
        <br/> with no special permissions assigned and it will still access these features.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/> <u>Users with <b>Manage Server</b> / <b>Administrator</b> permission</u>:
        <br/>
        <br/> • <b>Manage Server</b>: Users with the Manage Server permission can change Rythm’s settings,
        <br/> but are limited to <b>only</b> use the normal user's music commands.
        <br/>
        <br/> • <b>Administrator</b>: Users with the Administrator permission have full access to all music commands
        <br/> and can also change Rythm’s settings.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/> *******************************************<b>NOTICE</b>*******************************************:
        <br/> If a user is <b>ALONE WITH RYTHM</b> in a voice channel, they <b>WILL</b> have access to <b>ALL</b> music commands
        <br/> even if the user has <b>NO ROLES</b> in the server. This is because these commands wouldn't affect anyone
        <br/> but the user, as there would be no one else in the voice channel.
        <br/>
        <br/> If you want all Rythm commands to be only available to people with a specific role, read the next entry in this FAQ.
    How can I make Rythm only respond to Admins/specific roles?: |
        <br/> In order to make Rythm commands just available to specific roles you need to:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>1</b>- Make a text channel that can only be <b>seen</b> by users with the <b>specific role</b>.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>2</b>- Blacklist <b>all the other text channels</b> in the server with Rythm’s <b>Blacklist</b> function.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/> To blacklist channels use the following command format:
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>!settings blacklist <code>#channel</code> </b>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>Example</b>: !settings blacklist #general
    How do I give normal users access to all music commands?: |
        <br/> Users with the <b>Manage Channels</b> permission have access to all music commands by <b>default</b>.
        <br/> Users with the <b>Manage Server</b> permission <b>don’t</b>.
        <br/>
        <br/> However, if you wish to give <b>some users</b> access to <b>all music commands</b> without having to give
        <br/> them the <b>Manage Channels</b> permission, you can do so by creating a role named <b>DJ</b> in your server and
        <br/> assigning it to the users. This role doesn’t need to have any special Discord permissions.
        <br/>
        <br/> The <b>DJ</b> role has to be assigned manually and <b>cannot</b> be given to all users at once.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>Users alone in a voice channel with Rythm will be treated as though they have the DJ role until another user joins the voice channel with them even if they have no roles</b>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>Note</b>: Users with the <b>DJ</b> role <b>will not</b> be able to change or modify Rythm's <b>settings</b>.
    How can I block music commands in a specific text channel?: |
        <br/> To restrict music commands from working in a text channel, you must <b>blacklist</b>
        <br/> the channel with Rythm’s <b>Blacklist</b> function.
        <br/>
        <br/> To blacklist a text channel use the following command format:
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>!settings blacklist <code>#channel</code></b>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>Example</b>: !settings blacklist #general
    How can I limit the number of songs that one user can add to the queue?: |
        <br/> To restrict Rythm's queue to a specific number of songs per user you must use the settings menu.
        <br/>
        <br/> To limit the number of songs per user use the following command format:
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>!settings maxusersongs <code>Number</code>/<code>disable</code></b>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>Example</b>: !settings maxusersongs 5
        <br/>
        <br/> Now any songs added that will be put the queue over this number for a specific user will be blocked.
    How can I prevent duplicate songs from being added to the queue?: |
        <br/> To restrict duplicates from Rythm's queue you must use the settings menu.
        <br/>
        <br/> To prevent duplicate songs from being added to the queue use the following command format:
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>!settings preventduplicates <code>on</code>/<code>off</code></b>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>Example</b>: !settings preventduplicates on
        <br/>
        <br/> Now any songs added to the queue that are already in the queue will be blocked.
    How can I limit the number of songs that can be added to the queue?: |
        <br/> To restrict Rythm's queue to a specific number of songs you must use the settings menu.
        <br/>
        <br/> To limit the number of songs use the following command format:
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>!settings maxqueuelength <code>Number</code></b>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>Example</b>: !settings maxqueuelength 25
        <br/>
        <br/> Now any songs added that will put the queue over this number will be blocked.
    How do I restrict Rythm from joining a voice channel?: |
        <br/>To block Rythm from joining a specific voice channel you must:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>1</b>) Go to your Discord <b>Server Settings</b> &gt; <b>Roles</b>.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>2</b>) Find the role that belongs to <b>Rythm</b>.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>3</b>) Turn <b>OFF</b> the Administrator permission for Rythm.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>4</b>) Turn <b>ON</b> Read Text Channels & See Voice Channels, Send Messages, Embed Links, Connect and Speak Permissions.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>5</b>) Go to the voice channel you want to <b>restrict</b> Rythm from connecting to.

        <br/>
        <br/> <b>7</b>) Turn <b>OFF</b> the "Connect" permission for the Rythm role. Save.
        <br/>
        <br/> Done.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>Note</b>: To blacklist multiple channels, just repeat steps 5 to 7
        <br/> separately with all the voice channels you wish to blacklist.
