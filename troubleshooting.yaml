Basics:
    When adding Rythm I can't see my server on the list: |
        <br/> You must have a role with the “<b>Administrator</b>” or the “<b>Manage Server</b>” permission to be able to add Rythm to a <b>Discord Server</b>. If you have either of these permissions you should be able to change the name of your server.
        <br/>
        <br/> If you have the correct permission and <b>still can’t see</b> your server in the list, make sure you’re <b>logged into</b> the correct <b>Discord account</b> in your <b>web browser</b>.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>Note</b>: If that still doesn't work, we suggest trying <b>Incognito Mode</b> in your web browser or a <b>different browser</b> to invite Rythm to your server.
    Rythm left the voice channel while not playing anything: |
        <br/> For performance reasons, Rythm leaves after a while of being alone or unused in a voice channel.
        <br/> This helps Rythm save resources while no one is listening to it and keeps the music quality consistent for all users at any given time!
        <br/>
        <br/> Don't worry though, as long as you are in a voice channel, just type <b>!summon</b> to make Rythm rejoin your channel!
    Rythm forgets the playlist I queued after it leaves: |
        <br/> For performance reasons, Rythm will clear/reset the queue when it leaves the voice channel.
        <br/> To get around this we suggest creating a YouTube playlist of the songs you wish to re-queue.
    Rythm messages come out blank: |
        <br/> Rythm uses something called rich embeds for its messages, which is an option that <b>might be disabled</b> on your client. Make sure it's <b>enabled</b>!
        <br/>
        <br/> To do so:
        <br/>
        <br/> Go to your <b>Discord User Settings</b> > click on "<b>Text & Images</b>" > <b>Enable</b> "Show website preview info from links pasted into chat”.
        <br/>
        <br/> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dvmYgs9.png" alt="Link Preview" style="width:500px;height:330px;" />
    Rythm does not respond to commands: |
        <br/> If Rythm isn’t responding to commands, try the following:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>1.</b> <b>Ensure you’re using the correct prefix</b>. You can see the current prefix for Rythm by mentioning the bot.
        <br/> Example: <b>@Rythm#3722</b> OR <b><@!235088799074484224></b>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>2.</b> <b>Ensure Rythm has permission to send messages in the text channel.</b>
        <br/> You can give the “<b>Administrator</b>” permission to Rythm to make this easier.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>3.</b> Check the <code>#outages</code> channel on the Rythm Bot Discord server to see if there are any known issues.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>4.</b> If the above methods do not work, please choose option 7 in our <code>#help-desk</code> channel on the Rythm Bot Discord server to receive assistance from a member of our Support Team.

    How can I reset Rythm's prefix: |
        <br/> If you have changed the default Rythm prefix to a custom one and now can’t make Rythm work or aren’t able to change the prefix back, do the following:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>1.</b> <u>Mention Rythm.</u>
        <br/>
        <br/> You can do this by typing: <b>@Rythm#3722 </b> or <b><@!235088799074484224> </b>
        <br/>
        <br/> When you mention Rythm, do it in a text channel Rythm can send messages in.</b>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>2.</b> <u>Copy the Prefix response.</u>
        <br/>
        <br/> After mentioning Rythm, it should give you a message similar to this, but showing the prefix your Rythm is set to:
        <br/>
        <br/> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JLpuLHX.png" alt="Prefix Example" style="width:573px;height:150px;" />
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>You must Copy the part that is marked in red</b>.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>3.</b> <u>Run the prefix command.</u>
        <br/>
        <br/> Paste the copied text in the chat box and <b>right next to it</b> with <b>no spaces</b> type: settings prefix ! <br/> <br/> <u>Example</u>: To set the prefix back to <b>!</b> in the above picture, the command would be this:
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>;2Test-)29dsettings prefix ! </b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/> Note: You must have a role with the “Administrator” or the “Manage Server” permission to be able to change Rythm’s prefix.
    Rythm is responding to commands but not joining the voice channel: |
        <br/> If you find that Rythm is responding to your commands but not joining a voice channel use the following method:
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>1.</b> Move to a different voice channel.
        <br/> <b>2.</b> <b>!summon</b> the bot into that voice channel.
        <br/> <b>3.</b> Move back to the original voice channel.
        <br/> <b>4.</b> <b>!summon</b> the bot back into the original voice channel.
        <br/>
        <br/> If the above method does not work:
        <br/> Try changing the server region of your server or kicking & reinviting Rythm to your Discord server.
Sound issues:
    Rythm is lagging: |
        <br/> If you find that Rythm's sound has started to lag, perform the following checks in order:
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>1.</b> Kick Rythm out of the voice channel and resummon him using the commands <b>!dc</b> and then <b>!summon</b>.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>2.</b> Go to your server's <b>Server Settings</b> and change the server region a few times until you find a region where Rythm does not lag.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>3.</b> Check the Rythm Bot Discord server by typing <b>!invite</b> and selecting the <b>Official Discord</b> option and then checking the <code>#outages</code> channel to see if Rythm is currently having any known issues.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>4.</b> Kick and reinvite Rythm to your Discord server.
    Rythm doesn't play any sound: |

        <br/>
        <br/> <b>1.</b> Ensure that Rythm is not muted, if you right click on Rythm while it is in a voice channel <b>ensure the options in red are not ticked</b>:

        <br/>
        <br/> <b>2.</b> Ensure that Rythm's volume is not set to 0, if you right click on Rythm while it is in a music channel <b>ensure the slider in red is not set to 0</b>:

        <br/> <b>N.B: For donators:</b> use the <b>!vol</b> command to check that the server's volume has not been set to 0.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>3.</b> <b>Disconnect</b> from the voice channel and <b>Reconnect</b>.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>4.</b> Check the Rythm Bot Discord server by typing <b>!invite</b> and selecting the <b>Official Discord</b> option and then checking the <code>#outages</code> channel to see if Rythm is currently having any known issues.

        <br/> User Settings > Voice & Video > Output Device and Output Volume
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>6.</b> Check your computer's system volume.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>7.</b> Try reconnecting Rythm to your voice channel using the <b>!dc</b> and <b>!summon</b> commands.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>8.</b> Try changing the server region of your server a few times until you find a region where Rythm plays music.
        <br/> Server Settings > Overview > Server Region
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>9.</b> Ensure that the music is not paused. You can check this by using <b>!pause</b>. If the bot replies with <code>The player is already paused</code>, use <b>!resume</b> to start the music again.
Mobile:
    The screen to add Rythm to my server is gray and empty: |
        <br/> If you are on mobile and you find that you cannot add Rythm due to the fact that the link to add Rythm produces a gray screen, then please try first heading to <a href="https://discordapp.com/login">https://discordapp.com/login</a>, logging in and then using the invite link again.
        <br/> If that does not work, we recommend using a desktop device.
        <br/>
        <br/> In short: You may want to try refreshing the website to add Rythm or use a desktop device.
